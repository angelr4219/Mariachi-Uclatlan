      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>

      <h3>Origin and Early Years</h3>
    <p>
        Mariachi de Uclatlán was founded in 1961 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institute of Ethnomusicology. It holds the distinction of being the first collegiate mariachi group in the United States, pioneering the academic mariachi tradition. The ensemble's name combines "UCLA" with the Nahuatl suffix "-tlan," meaning "place of" or "land of," roughly translating to "Mariachi of the Land of UCLA."

        In 1964, Mariachi de Uclatlán was formally introduced as a course of study at UCLA, marking a significant milestone in the academic recognition of mariachi music.
